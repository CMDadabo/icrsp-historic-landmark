                    | Using the existing reminders of the interior of the former St. Gelasius with its Corinthian capitals and 
                    | high pilasters, the plan has been inspired by Renaissance and Baroque church buildings in Venice and 
                    | Rome, making of the Shrine a light-flooded hall. Clear lines and solid materials will draw all attention 
                    | to the sanctuary adorned with a magnificent high altar.
                p
                    | The interior and exterior of the Shrine will show a perfect harmony of late Renaissance and early Baroque 
                    | beauty.    This combination of styles will be at the same time elegant, sober, and awe-inspiring.    
                    | This is the ideal form for an impressive yet reasonable restoration of the future Shrine.

                p
                    | The vision for this restoration has been developed by a professional designer, Abbe Alexander Willweber, 
                    | whose experience includes the beautiful <a href='historic-restoration.html'>St. Mary&apos;s Restoration 
                    | in Wausau, Wisconsin</a>.    Implementing this vision will be craftsmen and artists from the United States 
                    | and Europe who will collaborate to bring classical beauty back to this historic building.
                p 
                    | The architect in charge of this project is especially suitable. William C. Heyer is a classical architect 
                    | who has studied the work of St. Gelasius&apos; original architect, the masterful Henry J. Schlacks. 
                    | Educated at Notre Dame, where Schlacks founded the architectural program, Mr. Heyer has the experience 
                    | in church restoration and classical architecture necessary to bring this Shrine back to life.
                h2 Restoration of a Neighborhood
                p
                    | The revival of the former St. Gelasius church will also be a great gift to the entire neighborhood and will 
                    | contribute positively to the thriving Hyde Park and Woodlawn communities in south Chicago.    Indeed, this is 
                    | already happening, as these once dilapidated neighborhoods are now bustling with new and restored homes and 
                    | condominiums, which themselves have a classical air about them and will blend beautifully with the Shrine.
