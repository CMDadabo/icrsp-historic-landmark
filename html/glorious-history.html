        <h1>Glorious History</h1>
        <h2>Masterpiece of Henry J. Schlacks</h2>
        <p>The former St. Clara/St. Gelasius church on the south side of Chicago was designed and built by the masterful Henry J. Schlacks in 1923.  Schlacks applied classical models from Italy, most particularly Rome, to the many magnificent churches he designed in Chicago during the early twentieth century.  Among these historical edifices that he built, the church of St. Clara/St. Gelasius stands out as his life's masterpiece, with its application of concepts from the many triumphal arches of antiquity, including the three arched doorways, and the four imposing statues placed above the pediment.</p>

        <h2>Its History</h2>
        <p>This historic landmark of Chicago was originally named St. Clara Parish and directed for many decades by the Carmelite Fathers. This history has been recorded in the adjacent street named "Carmelite Way."</p>
        <p>Until the late 1950's, the Church was also the National Shrine of St. Therese of Lisieux. Though the church was thriving, a significant change in the neighborhood began to diminish the parish membership considerably, which naturally created difficulties in maintaining the building.</p>

        <p>After a devastating fire in the late 1970's, the interior of the church was never brought back to the splendor that its outside promises.  Gorgeous statuary and delicate woodworking was lost. However, even in this moment of interior and exterior decay, the imposing structure was still one of the noblest churches in Chicago.</p>
        <h2>An Opportunity Presents Itself</h2>
        <p>Finally, at the turn of the millennium, the church was to be demolished.  But at the last moment, the destiny of the majestic edifice changed.  Francis Cardinal George, who had always regretted closing the church, was overjoyed at the possibility of preserving this historic gem.  The Cardinal gave the church to the Institute of Christ the King, a priestly order with a history of successful and beautiful church restorations (<a href="historic-restoration.html">see the restoration of St. Mary's in Wausau, Wisconsin</a>). In addition, the city of Chicago formally gave this church the prestigious historic landmark status.</p>

        <p>The former church of St. Gelasius will now be restored.  With many others who had lamented the loss of this unique house of God, the Cardinal is confident that the funds to restore this Shrine will be found through the generosity of Chicago citizens and all those who wish to participate in this most worthy project.</p>
