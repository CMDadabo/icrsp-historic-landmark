          <div class="right enlarge"><a href="http://www.historic-landmark.org/images/img31-large.jpg" title="High Altar"><img src="http://www.historic-landmark.org/images/img31.jpg" alt="high altar" height="300" width="200"></a>The future glorious high altar<br>(click to enlarge)</div>
          <p>The future of this historic landmark will be glorious indeed.</p>
          <h2>The Restoration Plan</h2>
          <div class="left"><img src="http://www.historic-landmark.org/images/img30.jpg" alt="sketch of future sanctuary" height="300" width="261">Sketch of the restoration plan<br><br><img src="http://www.historic-landmark.org/images/img34.jpg" alt="the future" height="170" width="200">Detail of the Shrine&apos;s<br>existing exterior columns</div>
          <p>
            Using the existing reminders of the interior of the former St. Gelasius with its Corinthian capitals and 
            high pilasters, the plan has been inspired by Renaissance and Baroque church buildings in Venice and 
            Rome, making of the Shrine a light-flooded hall. Clear lines and solid materials will draw all attention 
            to the sanctuary adorned with a magnificent high altar.
          </p>
          <p>
            The interior and exterior of the Shrine will show a perfect harmony of late Renaissance and early Baroque 
            beauty.  This combination of styles will be at the same time elegant, sober, and awe-inspiring.  
            This is the ideal form for an impressive yet reasonable restoration of the future Shrine.

          <h2>Experts Involved in the Project</h2>
          <p>
            The vision for this restoration has been developed by a professional designer, Abbe Alexander Willweber, 
            whose experience includes the beautiful <a href='historic-restoration.html'>St. Mary&apos;s Restoration 
            in Wausau, Wisconsin</a>.  Implementing this vision will be craftsmen and artists from the United States 
            and Europe who will collaborate to bring classical beauty back to this historic building.
          </p>
          <p>
             
            The architect in charge of this project is especially suitable. William C. Heyer is a classical architect 
            who has studied the work of St. Gelasius&apos; original architect, the masterful Henry J. Schlacks. 
            Educated at Notre Dame, where Schlacks founded the architectural program, Mr. Heyer has the experience 
            in church restoration and classical architecture necessary to bring this Shrine back to life.

          <h2>Centerpiece of the High Altar</h2>
          <p>The statue that will be placed above the high altar has already been chosen and acquired, thanks to the </p>kindness of a very generous benefactor. Although part of its history is lost, it is certain that this 
          wooden statue dates from the early seventeenth century and was carved by the famous school of early baroque 
          sculptors of Seville in southern Spain. It would not be too far fetched to imagine that this statue might 
          have been commissioned for one of the Carmelite monasteries of Andalusia, among whom devotion to the Child 
          was popular&mdash;an echo back to the days that this Shrine was under the care of the Carmelites.  The 
          crown and orb (held in the left hand) of the statue are missing and will now have to be supplied, as well 
          as the attendant vestments.
          <h2>Restoration of a Neighborhood</h2>
          <p>The revival of the former St. Gelasius church will also be a great gift to the entire neighborhood and will </p>contribute positively to the thriving Hyde Park and Woodlawn communities in south Chicago.  Indeed, this is 
          already happening, as these once dilapidated neighborhoods are now bustling with new and restored homes and 
          condominiums, which themselves have a classical air about them and will blend beautifully with the Shrine.
